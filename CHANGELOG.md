# Changelog

All notable changes to `oxideav-vp8` are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* **Boolean (range) entropy decoder** per RFC 6386 §7
  (`BoolDecoder` in `src/bool_decoder.rs`). This is the foundational
  primitive every higher-level VP8 decode step reads through. Surface:
  `init`, `read_bool`, `read_literal`, `read_signed_literal`, plus
  `range()` / `value()` / `remaining_input()` accessors for testing.
  An `EndOfStream` error is surfaced explicitly when renormalisation
  needs a byte the partition no longer has, rather than silently
  returning stale bits.
* Nine unit tests covering init validation, round-trip against an
  in-test reference encoder over a probability sweep, literal /
  signed-literal handling (including the spec's `-1`-initialised
  signed accumulator), the `128 ≤ range ≤ 255` invariant across
  reads, and the end-of-stream signal.

### Changed

* **Orphan rebuild (2026-05-20).** The crate was reset to a clean-room
  scaffold. The prior implementation contained module-level docstrings
  and inline comments whose provenance could not be defended against
  the workspace clean-room rule. Orphan-master rebuild per workspace
  policy; no `old` branch retained. License also reset to clean MIT.

  Every public API path other than the new `BoolDecoder` still
  returns `Error::NotImplemented`. A clean-room re-implementation of
  the frame header, macroblock decode, prediction, IDCT, and loop
  filter is planned for subsequent rounds.
